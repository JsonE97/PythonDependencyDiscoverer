Dependency Discoverer implementation for .c files

NOTE  - this is a reimplementation of the java dependency discoverer in my repository
USAGE - the user can simply run the python script without args to run with the base data in "./Dataset/" or
        they can pass in 1 command arg for their own custom directory
